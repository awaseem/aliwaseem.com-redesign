      <P>
        My name is Ali Waseem.
        I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and playing video games is my hobby.
        I studied at the University of Calgary as an Electrical and
        Computer Engineer and I love to program and tinker with technology.
        I also love JavaScript, Java, Python and C and love to mess
        around with new web frameworks.
        I love making random websites that do random and cool things.
      </P>
    </div>
